# Linked-In-Bots

## Overview:
Our project is to inform users of LinkedIn about the likelihood that a profile they are viewing could be generated by a bot, which Enhances transparency, Decreases the prevalence of false profiles
and Makes LinkedIn a more trustworthy platform for genuine users.

## Problem
* Overestimate the prevalence of bots 
* Exposure tends to impair judgment of bot-recognition self-efficacy 
* Increase propensity toward stricter bot-regulation policies 
* Decreased self-efficacy and increased perceptions of bot influence

## Research Question
What are characteristics or patterns we can use to detect LLM profile generated bots on Linkedin?

## Data Description
This dataset comprises a total of 3600 LinkedIn profiles, categorized into three main groups:

* Legitimate LinkedIn Profiles (LLPs): 1800 profiles
* Fake LinkedIn Profiles (FLPs): 600 profiles
* ChatGPT-generated LinkedIn Profiles (CLPs): 1200 profiles

## Model Labels

* Label 0: Legitimate LinkedIn Profiles (LLPs)
* Label 1: Fake LinkedIn Profiles (FLPs)
* Label 10: ChatGPT-generated LinkedIn Profiles (CLPs) created based on legitimate profiles' statistics
* Label 11: ChatGPT-generated LinkedIn Profiles (CLPs) created based on fake profiles' statistics

## Goals
We aim to inform users of LinkedIn about the likelihood that a profile they are viewing could be generated by a bot, which
Enhances transparency, Decreases the prevalence of false profiles, make LinkedIn a more trustworthy platform for genuine users

## Solution

We want to create a visual comparison between fake and real profiles on LinkedIn to show awareness for students.
We also want to share our models for students to test and determine if the profile is legit on LinkedIn.
